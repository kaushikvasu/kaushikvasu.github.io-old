title: First Blog Post!

Hi everyone!
It's my first blog post! I just finished one week at the Metis Data Science Bootcamp. It's been a lot of fun meeting new people and learning different skills that I will need as a Data Scientist.

On a sports related note, it has been a pretty sad couple weeks in fantasy football recently. Adrian Peterson and Abdullah, two of my key RB are out for the season, and I don't even have the most injured fantasy roster. Hopefully once I master Data Science I can accurately predict at what point RB breakdown to avoid drafting Adrian 3rd overrall. 

Not only is Fantasy Football going poorly, Bay Area sports in general seems a little depressing. Every day that goes by with the Giants barely clinging to the Wildcard is one more stressfull day, and don't even get me started on the drop in the Niners expectations from week 1 to now. 

On the brightside, basketball is almost back! All the California teams are looking to get back on track, albeit with wildly differing expecations. Warriors are of course back with the best team in basketball, and about to drain the rest of the league in 3s with the "Splash Family" (aka. Curry, Klay, and Durant). Kings will hopefully not implode again, when they play well, they're tough to beat. Clippers I hate. And finally the Lakers are looking set for the next couple years with future stars in DeAngelo Russel and Brandon Ingram. Can't wait for the Lakers to finally be almost relevant again, even if my favorite player is now Klay Thompson now that Kobe has retired.  It's going to be a weird year with no Kobe, Garnett, or Duncan.

Anyway, this week I'm going to be presenting on NBA Data Analytics in Metis. I'll let you all know how it goes.

See you later,
Kaushik
