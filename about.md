Hey!
If you didn't already know, my name is Kaushik Vasudevan. I graduated in 2015 from NYU with a Bachelor's in Sociology before moving back to the Bay Area. I am very interested in Data Science and Sports, and specifically the intersection of the two. I am currently attending Metis: Data Science Bootcamp in San Francisco.
